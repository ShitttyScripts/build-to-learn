# Build to learn [![Thanks](http://bit.ly/saythankss)](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev)

> Attempts at building things for deeper understanding/practice

The repo is organized into sections by context (language/technology). Each section has little projects with code. Bigger projects are extracted into [their own GitHub repos](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github). The purpose of this repo is a playground for ideas & new learnings.

I also use this repo to test out code in different languages. I ignore these test files as they may contain sensitive info. The actual repo for me looks like:

```bash
~/src/build-to-learn
❯ tree -L 2
├── bash
│   └── test.sh
├── go
│   ├── test.go
├── python
│   ├── test.py
```

I have Alfred workflow that searches through the root folders in this repo. On return, the folder gets opened in VS Code.

I can open a lot of these test files directly with [KM macro](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros):

I then use VS Code's [CodeRunner extension](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner) to quickly run code in those specific files. Makes prototyping ideas and libraries a breeze.

I use a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) (left column) to track ideas for small projects I want to build. And I have [Ideas board](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) for tracking ideas I actually wish existed & I can use.

## Puzzles / practice

I love solving puzzles.

## Contributing

I'm [open to ideas](../../issues/new) of things I can try out and build. Assuming it doesn't already exist on my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP).
