> My attempts at building things for deeper understanding/practice

The repo is organized into sections by context (language/technology). Each section has projects and appropriate readmes describing the projects inside.

Bigger projects are often extracted into [their own GitHub repos](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github).

I also use this repo as a way to quickly test out stuff in certain language/framework. Usually this is done by activating a [KM macro](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros) like this:

I also have a macro that will automatically open/switch to this project.
