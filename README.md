# Build to learn

> My attempts at building things for deeper understanding/practice

The repo is organized into sections by context (language/technology). Each section has projects and appropriate readmes describing the projects inside.

Bigger projects are often extracted into [their own GitHub repos](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github).
