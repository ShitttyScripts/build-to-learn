# Build to learn [![Thanks](http://bit.ly/saythankss)](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev)

> Attempts at building things for deeper understanding/practice

The repo is organized into sections by context (language/technology). Each section has projects with code and some readmes describing the projects inside.

Bigger projects are often extracted into [their own GitHub repos](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github). The purpose of this repo is a playground for ideas & new learnings.

I have Alfred workflow that searches through the root folders in this repo. On return, the folder gets opened in VS Code.

I also use this repo as a way to quickly test out stuff in certain language/framework. Usually this is done by activating a macro like this:

I then use [VS Code CodeRunner](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner) extension to quickly run code in those specific files. Makes prototyping ideas and libraries a breeze.

I use a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) (left column) to track ideas for small projects I want to build. I have [another board](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) for tracking ideas I actually wish existed & I can use. Includes bigger ideas I want to build out.

## Puzzles

I also like solving various puzzles. Below are solutions to ones I attempted to solve.

- [LeetCode](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/leetcode)
- [Project Euler](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/euler)

## Contributing

I'm [open to ideas](../../issues/new) of things I can try out and build. Assuming it doesn't already exist on my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP).
