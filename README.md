The repo is organized into sections by context (language/technology). Each section has projects and appropriate readmes describing the projects inside.

Bigger projects are often extracted into [their own GitHub repos](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github).

I have a [KM macro](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros) that will automatically open/switch to this project.

I also use this repo as a way to quickly test out stuff in certain language/framework. Usually this is done by activating a macro like this:

I then use [VS Code CodeRunner](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner) extension to quickly run code in those specific files. Makes prototyping ideas and libraries a breeze.
